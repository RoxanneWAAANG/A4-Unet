# A4-Unet: A Brain Tumor Segmentation Architecture with Multi-Attention Mechanism
A4-Unet is a brain tumor segmentation architecture for Medical Image Segmentation. The algorithm is elaborated on our paper [A4-Unet: Deformable Multi-Scale Attention Network for Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06088).


## A Quick Overview

**A4-Unet** 

***Architecture***
The overall framework of A4-Unet is structured as follows:
* Encoder: Large-kernel convolutions with variable sizes to capture multi-scale information.
* Bottleneck: SSPP for hierarchical feature extraction.
* Decoder: DCT-based attention combined with skip connections for refined segmentation output.

***Contributions & Features***
* Multi-scale feature extraction using large-kernel variable convolutions.
* Swin Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SSPP) for global and local feature integration.
* DCT-based channel attention for enhanced decoder performance.
* Efficient segmentation with skip connections and attention-based aggregation.
